      <description>On Saturday August 25, 2018 at 8:08 PM I finally hit Inbox Zero!
I did it by immediately copying the snippets of email I wanted into Evernote notes (my notetaking system). I also attended to to-dos more immediately, or added them to a note of “To-Dos”.
I doubt I will stay at zero emails in my inbox, but I have been at fewer than 10 emails all summer. Hoping to keep things at this level as the semester gears up.</description>
