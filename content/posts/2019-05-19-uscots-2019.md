Last week I attended the [United States Conference on Teaching Statistics](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/program). The biennial conference, which took place at Penn State, attracts statistics educators and statistics education researchers from across the world. It was a fantastic conference with keynotes from [Jane Watson](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/keynote/1), [Allen Schirm and Ron Wasserstein](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/keynote/2), [John Kruschke](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/keynote/3), and [Kari Lock Morgan](https://www.causeweb.org/cause/uscots/uscots19/keynote/4). 

I cajoled four of my graduate students (Jonathan Brown, Mike Huberty, Chelsey Legacy, and Vimal Rao) to tag along, and it was fun to see them interacting with the people and ideas presented. Our alumni from the statistics education program were also well represented with posters and breakout sessions led by myself, Laura Le, Laura Ziegler, and Matt Beckman.
