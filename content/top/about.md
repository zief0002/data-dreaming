### About Me

I am an Associate Professor of Teaching and researcher in the [Quantitative Methods in Education](http://www.cehd.umn.edu/EdPsych/programs/QME/) program within the Department of Educational Psychology at the University of Minnesota. I currently teach undergaraduate and graduate-level courses in statistics and train and supervise graduate students in statistics education. In a previous life I taught mathematics and A.P. Statistics at [ROCORI High School](http://www.rocori.k12.mn.us/rocori-high-school) in Cold Spring, MN.

My scholarship focuses on statistics education. I have authored/co-authored several papers and book chapters related to statistics education, and have been a co-PI on many NSF-funded statistics education research projects. Additionally, I have co-authored two textbooks that serve as an introduction to modern statistical and computational methods for students in the educational and behavioral sciences.

Currently, I serve as co-editor of the journal [Technology Innovations in Statistics Education](http://escholarship.org/uc/uclastat_cts_tise). My research interests have recently been focused on teacher education and also on how data science is transforming the statistics curriculum. In 2018, I was part of a study group formed by the *National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine* that authored the report, [Data Science for Undergraduates: Opportunities and Options](https://www.nap.edu/catalog/25104/data-science-for-undergraduates-opportunities-and-option).
