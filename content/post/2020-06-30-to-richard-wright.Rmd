*Four Sheets to the Wind* <br />
*And a One Way Ticket to France*

<br />

As a child <br />
I bought a red scarf and women told me how beautiful it looked, <br />
wandering through the sous-sols as France wandered through me.


In the evenings <br />
I would watch the funny people make love the way Maupassant said, <br />
my youth allowed me the opportunity to hear all those strange <br />
verbs conjugated in erotic affirmations. I knew love at twelve.

When Salassie went before his peers and Dillinger goofed <br />
I read in two languages, not really caring which one belonged to me.

My mother lit a candle for King George, my father went broke, we died. <br />
When I felt blue the Champs understood, and when it was crowded <br />
the alley behind Harry's New York Bar soothed my restless spirit.

I liked to watch the nonconformists gaze at the paintings <br />
along Gauguin's bewildered paradise.

Braque once passed me in front of Café Misique. <br />
I used to watch those sneaky professors examine the populace. <br />
Americans never quite fitted in but they tried, so we smiled.

I guess the money was too much for my folks. <br />
Hitler was such a prig and a scare. We caught the long boat. <br />
I stayed.

Main Street was never the same. I read Gide and tried to <br />
translate Proust. Now nothing is real except French wine. <br />
For absurdity is reality, my loneliness unreal, my mind tired.

And I shall die an old Parisian.
