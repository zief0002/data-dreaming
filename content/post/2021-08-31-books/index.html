<p>I went to the Arc today and bought several books. (It’s hard to beat a price tag of 2.99!) So, in the spirit of Nick Hornby’s column in the <em>Guardian</em>, I thought I would chronicle these books along with the reason I bought each.</p>
<div id="books-bought" class="section level3">
<h3>BOOKS BOUGHT:</h3>
<p><strong>Bruce</strong>—<em>Peter Ames Carlin</em>: A biography of Bruce Springsteen, bought because he is The Boss.</p>
<p><strong>Going for a Beer</strong> and <strong>A Night at the Movies or, You Must Remember This</strong>—<em>Robert Coover</em>: I got into Coover’s work after reading a book on writing in which he was featured in a chapter. He has written some really great short stories and he also was a founder of the Electronic Literature Organization in 1999 which promotedthe publication of literature in the “new” electronic format.</p>
<p><strong>The Black Death</strong>—<em>Philip Ziegler</em>: A book on the plague that swept through Europe in the mid 1300s wiping out one-third of the English population in three years. I have several books on pandemics; from Ebola to the flu. Maybe I will one day want to read about COVID as well.</p>
<p><strong>Roads Less Traveled: Dispatches from the Ends of the Earth</strong>—<em>Catherine Watson</em>: Watson was the first travel editor for the Minneapolis Star Tribune (so the back cover of the book tells me). This book of travel essays I bought on a lark and am hoping her perspective as a native Minnesotan will resonate.</p>
<p><strong>Enduring Love</strong>—<em>Ian McEwan</em>: I have most of McEwan’s oevre and have loved all of them.</p>
<p><strong>The Keeper of Lost Causes</strong>—<em>Jussi Adler-Olsen</em>: This is a detective story that I picked up because I liked the title. Plus there is a bird cage on the cover. Who doesn’t want to read a book that has a bird cage on the cover. The front cover also tells me that the author won the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_Key_award">Glass Key Award</a>, so I am optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>Ojibwe Waasa Inaabida: We Look in All Directions</strong>—<em>Thomas Peacock</em> and <em>Marlene Wisuri</em>: I have a large collection of books on the Native Americans of the plains and especially of Minnesota. Fun fact: When I was a youngster and we were asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, while most of my classmates said astronaut or baseball player, my answer was Crazy Horse.</p>
<p><strong>A Man Called Ove</strong>—<em>Fredrik Backman</em>: This has been on my Goodreads “to-read” list for awhile. My sister tells me it is great!</p>
<p><strong>The Trial of Henry Kissinger</strong>—<em>Christopher Hitchens</em>: Hitchens is another author I read a lot of. He was a Republican columnist that I truly respected and a brilliant debater. His feud with Gore Vidal is legendary and the shade that they dished was top-notch. I miss really, really smart people arguing the merits of a thing rather than just trying to out-shout each other.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard Cohen: Hallelujah</strong>—<em>Tim Footman</em>: A biography of the late, great Leonard Cohen. Poet. Song writer. And a voice that gives you shivers.</p>
<p><strong>The Art Spirit</strong>—<em>Robert Henri</em>: This is the writings that lay out the philosophy espoused by Henri on whta it means to be an artist. I feel a kindred spirit to artists, so this sounded good to me.</p>
<p><strong>Staying the Course: A Runner’s Toughest Race</strong>—<em>Dick Beardsley</em> and <em>Maureen Anderson</em>: In the 1982 Boston Marathon, Beardsley lost by 2 seconds to Alberto Salzar. This book tells that story and the aftermath of Beardsley’s life (farm accident, almost overdosing, addiction) from his point of view. I read <em>Duel in the Sun</em> a year or so ago (about this race) and loved every second. I hope this will be as good.</p>
<p><strong>John Dillinger Slept Here: A Crook’s Tour of Crime and Corruption in St. Paul, 1920-1936</strong>—<em>Paul Maccabee</em>: I also have several books on crime in Minnesota. Someday I might put together a map that pins locations of interest by culling the info in these books….in all my infinite spare time.</p>
