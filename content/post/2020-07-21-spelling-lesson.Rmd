Came across this funny ditty by [Ralph P. Boas](https://mathshistory.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Boas/) in the June 1984 issue of *The College Mathematics Journal*. The complete citation is: Boas, R. P. (1984). Spelling lesson. *The College Mathematics Journal, 15*(3), 217.

**Spelling Lesson** <br />


Weep for the mathematicians<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;Posterity acclaims:<br />
Although we know their theorems<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;We cannot spell their names.<br />

Forget the rules you thought you knew<br />
Henri Lebesgue has got no Q.<br />

Although it almost rhymes with Birkhoff,<br />
Two H's grace the name of Kirchhoff.<br />

The Schwarz of inequality<br />
And lemma too, he has no T.<br />

The "distribution" Schwartz, you see<br />
Is French, and so he has a T.<br />

In Turing's name&mdash;no German, he&mdash;<br />
An umlaut we should never see.<br />

Hermann Grassmann&mdash;please try to<br />
Spell both his names with 2 N's, too.<br />

If you should ever have to quote<br />
A Harvard Peirce, be sure to note<br />
He has the E before the I;<br />
And so does Klein. Rules still apply<br />
To Wiener: I precedes the E;<br />
The same for Riemann, as you see.<br />
But Weierstrass, the lucky guy,<br />
Has it both ways, with EIE.<br />

Fejer, Turan, Cesaro, Frechet&mdash;<br />
Let's make the accents go that way,<br />

And as for Radon-Nikod&yacute;m,<br />
Restore the accent, that's my dream.<br />

"Stokes's theorem" is O.K.<br />
"Stokes' theorem" is an awkward way.<br />
"Stoke's theorem" seems to be a joke,<br />
Or did you think his name was "Stoke?"<br />

But there is one I leave to you,<br />
Whatever you may choose to do:<br />
Put letters in or leave them out,<br />
Garnish with accents round about,<br />
Finish the name with eff or off:<br />
There is no way to spell &#1063;&#1077;&#1073;&#1099;&#1096;&euml;&#1074;<br />
