I have written several notes to myself over the years as reminders. These include ideas for research, R packages I have seen and may use sometime), things to-do, etc.  I am in the process of making some of these notes more public on my blog. This will act as a more searchable, curated "note" for myself, but also makes it available to anyone else who would benefit.
